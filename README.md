## Description
Welcome to the Dog and Cat Binary Classification GitHub repository! This project focuses on the application of deep learning techniques to distinguish between images of dogs and cats. The dataset used for training consists of a diverse collection of 700 images, providing a robust foundation for building an effective binary classification model.
## Approach
his project employs a deep learning approach, leveraging the powerful DenseNet model based on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). CNNs are well-suited for image classification tasks, and DenseNet's dense connectivity pattern helps enhance feature reuse, leading to more efficient learning.
## Dataset
The training dataset comprises a total of 700 images, carefully curated to cover various poses, backgrounds, and lighting conditions for both dogs and cats. The diversity of the dataset ensures that the model generalizes well to different scenarios, enhancing its real-world applicability.
